GRAY

For every pixel:
    Make sum of every color
    Make average
    Make every color average

REFLECT

Calculate ammount of iterations (half of the pixels)

For every row:
    For every iteration:
        Swap this pixel with pixel at the end minus this pixel index

BLUR

Make copy of image
For every pixel:
    For every pixel around this pixel:
        If pixel exist:
            Sum values of every color
            Add count
    Calculate average of every color
    Set copy pixel with average
Fill original image with blurred image from copy

EDGES

Make copy of image
For every pixel (Gx):
    For every pixel around this pixel:
        If pixel doesn't exist:
            Make every color value as zero
        Else:
            If height fix is equal 0:
                Value of every color is equal (Sum of every color + (color value * (width fix * 2)))
            Else:
                Value of every color is equal (Sum of every color + (color value * width fix))
    Add values to copy - (copy[x][y] + Gx^2)

For every pixel (Gy):
    For every pixel around this pixel:
        If pixel doesn't exist:
            Make every color value as zero
        Else:
            If width fix is equal 0:
                Value of every color is equal (Sum of every color + (color value * (height fix * 2)))
            Else:
                Value of every color is equal (Sum of every color + (color value * height fix))
    Add values to copy - (copy[x][y] + Gy^2)

for evey pixel in copy:
    Every value = square root(value)
    if value is bigger than 255:
        cap at 255

For every pixel:
    replace original image with copy
