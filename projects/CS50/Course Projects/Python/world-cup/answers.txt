Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With minimum simulations, every prediction proved to be incorrect.
When the number of simulations was increased to moderate value, predictions for France and Croatia became more accurate.
Further increasing the number of simulations, however, resulted in a decrease in the accuracy of these outcomes.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would consider the predictions "good enough" after 1000 simulations, as increasing the number of simulations beyond 1000, clearly decreased accuracy and incurred
 higher cost in terms of resources.
